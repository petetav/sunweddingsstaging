<h4>May 18th 2019 - Donagh and Sarah</h4>
<p>"Excellent planner, super responsive, very organised and a lovely person to be around and communicate with. Marian took over our wedding in the Algarve from another planner who we had to part ways with. She inherited quite a mess and dealt with it with compassion and competence. Everything went perfect on the day. We would 100% recommend Sun Weddings Portugal."</p>

<P>"We chose Marian as our celebrant and it was the best decision we have ever made. From the moment I met her I just loved her and knew we were in good hands and she just couldn't do enough for us. She sent us a questionnaire months prior so she could get a feel for our relationship/personalities and as we are not religious I wanted it to feel personal and romantic and honestly there wasn't a dry eye on that cliff top, she also printed out all our poems and a song my son was singing plus supplying sand and bottles for our sand ceremony as I forgot to bring them from Ireland and didn't know where to get them in Portugal! I honestly can't thank her enough she is also a wedding planner and I'd say you would be in safe hands with her.<br>
Thank you Marian xxxx"</p>

<p>"Marian was a perfect choice for us. We had a very small wedding with just myself my husband and our 2 kids. She planned our wedding on the beach and was also our celebrant. She made everything so easy for us and stress free.<br> I would highly recommend Marian."</p>

<h4>9th June 2018 - Emily and Iain</h4>
<p>"Marian did a brilliant job helping us plan our ceremony. We were married by a Registrar in Portuguese with English translation, followed by a non-religious celebration led by Marian. Her calm, fun energy added so much. She made the ceremony really personal and explained the legal section and order so well to our guests. Couldnâ€™t recommend her help enough.<br> 
Thank you Marian!"</p>

<h4>14th June 2018 - Faye and Sam</h4>
<p>"Marian was so so lovely on our wedding day in Portugal back in June. She planned it and was also our celebrant. She was really good with our two small babies as well and was so friendly and made us feel very comfortable and at ease. I would highly recommend her as a planner and to perform your wedding ceremony and also her husband was our photographer and he was so nice and friendly we had so much fun working with him. We loved working with them both.<br>
Thank you both so much X"</p>
